The Threshold Correction Maze Solver is a web based display, solving, and storage system for two-dimensional mazes. Mazes are represented by a grid of squares. On the Maze Display page the user starts with a completely white grid and then clicks on the squares to change their state between white and black. White squares represent the floor and can be transversed. Black squares represent the walls of the maze and cannot be transversed. Each maze has two more types of squares, the start and the end of the maze. When the solve button on the maze display is pressed, a path from the start to the end square will be found and displayed. This path is found using the A* algorithm. From the Maze management
page, mazes can be renamed, deleted or saved to the user’s database. Mazes saved to the database can be reopened in the Maze Display. The final page of the application is the Maze Stats page. This page displays graphs created from the maze data saved in the user’s database.
